Approach for the Code
This code demonstrates how to process a PDF document, extract text, create semantic embeddings, and perform a similarity search to answer user queries. Here's the detailed breakdown of the approach:

1. Model and Library Setup
Libraries Used:
faiss: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
sentence_transformers: To encode textual data into dense embeddings for semantic similarity.
PyMuPDF (fitz): For PDF text extraction.
requests and io: To handle both local and remote PDFs (via URLs).
pickle: To cache embeddings for faster reuse.
Model Initialization:
The SentenceTransformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) is used to generate embeddings for textual data. This is a lightweight transformer-based model optimized for semantic similarity tasks.

2. Extracting Text from PDF
Function: extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
Extracts text from a PDF file, handling both local files and URLs.
If the pdf_path starts with "http", the PDF is fetched via HTTP, converted to a byte stream, and processed.
For local files, it directly reads the PDF using fitz.

3. Chunking the Text
Function: chunk_text(text, chunk_size=500)
Splits the extracted text into smaller chunks (default size: 500 words).
These smaller chunks ensure that the embeddings are more manageable and relevant for semantic search.

4. Creating Embeddings
Function: create_embeddings(chunks, embeddings_cache_path="embeddings.pkl")
Purpose: Converts text chunks into dense vector representations (embeddings).
If embeddings are cached (stored as a .pkl file), it loads them to save computation time.
Otherwise, embeddings are created using the SentenceTransformer model and stored in a pickle file for future use.

5. Storing Embeddings in FAISS
Function: store_embeddings_in_faiss(embeddings)
Purpose: Adds the embeddings to a FAISS index for similarity search.
Creates an IndexFlatL2 index for L2 (Euclidean distance) similarity.
Converts the embeddings into a NumPy array (float32 type) and adds them to the index.

6. Performing Similarity Search
Function: search_embeddings(query, index, chunks, top_k=3)
Purpose: Finds the top k text chunks most relevant to the user’s query.
Steps:
Encodes the user query into an embedding using the same SentenceTransformer model.
Performs a similarity search on the FAISS index to find the closest embeddings to the query.
Returns the corresponding text chunks.

7. Generating a Response
Function: generate_response(user_query, relevant_chunks)
Purpose: Combines the most relevant text chunks into a context and formulates a response.
The response structure includes:
The user’s query.
The most relevant chunks from the PDF content.

8. Pipeline Execution
Function: run_pipeline(pdf_path, user_query)
Combines all steps into a single pipeline:
Text Extraction: Extract text from the given PDF (URL or local).
Text Chunking: Split the text into manageable pieces.
Embedding Creation: Generate and/or load cached embeddings.
Index Storage: Store embeddings in FAISS for efficient retrieval.
Similarity Search: Retrieve the most relevant chunks for the user query.
Response Generation: Generate a meaningful response based on the relevant chunks.

9. Example Execution
Input PDF:
A remote PDF document located at https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/dolciani/....
This PDF is downloaded, processed, and text is extracted.
User Query:
"From page 2 get the exact unemployment information based on type of degree input"
The pipeline processes the query to fetch the relevant content from the PDF.

Output:
The system identifies and retrieves the text chunks that are semantically most relevant to the query and includes them in the response.

Key Features
Semantic Similarity: Uses embeddings to match the query with contextually relevant parts of the text.
Efficient Search: FAISS ensures fast and scalable similarity searches.
Scalability: Handles large PDFs by splitting them into chunks.
Caching: Embedding caching avoids redundant computation.
Flexibility: Handles both local and remote PDFs seamlessly.

Use Case
This pipeline can be used for:
Extracting insights from large PDF documents.
Building question-answering systems for reports, research papers, or manuals.
Automating document analysis tasks for various industries.
